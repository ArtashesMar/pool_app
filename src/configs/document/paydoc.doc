**Business Logic for Payment Process**

### **Phase 1: Booking and Advance Payment**
1. The customer selects the type of work they need.
2. They choose a convenient time slot from the available options.
3. The customer makes an **advance payment** to confirm the booking.
4. Cancellation policy:
   - If the customer cancels **less than 2 days before the appointment**, the advance payment is **non-refundable**.
   - If the service provider fails to deliver the service, the **advance payment is refunded within 1 day**.
   - If the service is successfully provided, the advance payment is deducted from the final amount.

### **Phase 2: Payment Deduction and Dispute Process**
1. Before the start of the work, the **remaining balance is charged** from the customer's payment method.
2. After the work is completed, the customer can review the results.
3. If the customer is **not satisfied**, they can open a dispute online.
   - Depending on the resolution, the customer may receive a **partial or full refund**.
   
### **Phase 3: Order Closure**
1. The customer **confirms** that the work has been completed to their satisfaction.
2. Once confirmed, the order is **officially closed**.
3. In **exceptional cases**, the **administration can close the order** if necessary.
